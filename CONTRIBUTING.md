## Types / Typechain

To update the types generated by [Typechain](https://github.com/ethereum-ts/TypeChain) run the following `npm` command:

```bash
npm run generate-types
```

In the [package.json](package.json) file under `scripts` there is a `post-install` hook, which also runs `generate-types` every time you install a package.
